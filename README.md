# Database Uploader

## Project Description
This project is a **simple Python application** that allows users to upload data to a Supabase database through a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit. The motivation behind this project is to provide an easy way to manage and 
upload data without needing extensive programming knowledge. This tool is particularly useful for users who want to leverage the power of Supabase as a backend for their applications.
